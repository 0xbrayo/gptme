Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking> To patch the code in hello.py, I will use the patch tool. I will create a patch block with the original content and the updated content. In this case, the original content is the current print statement, and the updated content is the new print statement. I will also specify the filename as hello.py. </thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking> It seems that the patch I provided was larger than the file, which is not ideal. In this case, it would be better to use the save tool to rewrite the whole file. I will create a new save block with the updated content. </thinking>

```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py

The file now contains the updated print statement.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
