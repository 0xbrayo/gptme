def hello():

>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: In that case, I can rewrite the entire file to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. Here's the updated version:

```save hello.py
def hello():
    name = input("What is your name? ")
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
