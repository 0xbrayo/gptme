Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", I'll apply a patch to modify the print statement. 

Let's proceed with the patch. 

<tool-use>
<patch args="/app/hello.py">
<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Invalid patch: invalid patch, no `<<<<<<< 
ORIGINAL`

It seems there was an issue with the patch format. Let me correct that and try again. 

<tool-use>
<patch args="/app/hello.py">
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

+print("Hello, human!")

It seems that the file `hello.py` is not located in the `/app` directory. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to locate `hello.py`. 

<tool-use>
<execute>
pwd
</execute>
</tool-use>                                                                                [04:04:08] Session: $0.02 | 3 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
