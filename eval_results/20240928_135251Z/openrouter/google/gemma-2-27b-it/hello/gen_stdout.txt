```python

I will create a file named `hello.py` and write the Python code `print("Hello, world!")` inside it.

</thinking>

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.

Great! Now you have a Python script called `hello.py` that will print "Hello, world!" when you run it. 

Do you want to run it now?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
