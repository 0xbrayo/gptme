User: 
Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

<thinking>
The user wants to change the greeting from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

We can use the `patch` tool to modify the existing code.

</thinking>
```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

<thinking>
You are right!

Since the patch is essentially replacing the whole content of the file, using the `save` tool would be more efficient and clearer.

</thinking>

```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Great! Now the file `hello.py` will print "Hello, human!" when executed.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
