User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: ```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(nth):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < nth:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    prime_100 = nth_prime(100)
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {prime_100}")
```

Saving to prime.py

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Let's run the script to compute and print the 100th prime number:

```bash
python3 prime.py
```

The 100th prime number is: 541

System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

stdout: `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! The script successfully computed that the 100th prime number 
is **541**.

If you'd like to:

- **Compute a different prime number**, 
- **Optimize the script further**, or
- **Explore other programming tasks**,

feel free to let me know! I'm here to help.
