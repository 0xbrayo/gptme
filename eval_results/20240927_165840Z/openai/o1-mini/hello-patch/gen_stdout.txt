User: 
Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: ```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Apologies for the inconvenience. The patch was indeed larger than the
file, which made it unsuitable for applying. Let's use the `save` tool to update
`hello.py` directly.

```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```
Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! Let's run `hello.py` to verify the changes:

```bash
python hello.py
```

Hello, human!

System: 
Ran command: `python hello.py`

stdout: `Hello, human!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Excellent! Your `hello.py` script is now printing:

```
Hello, human!
```
