User: create a Rust project in a hello_world directory, write a hello world 
program (that doesnt take input), build it to a binary called `hello_world`, and
run it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
I need to create a Rust project, write a "Hello, world!" program, build it, and run it.  I'll use the `shell` tool to execute commands.  I'll break this down into steps.
</thinking>

First, let's create the directory and the project:

```bash
mkdir hello_world && cd hello_world && cargo new --bin hello_world
```                                                                                

System: 
Ran command: `mkdir hello_world && cd hello_world && cargo new --bin 
hello_world`

stderr:
```
Creating binary (application) `hello_world` package
note: see more `Cargo.toml` keys and their definitions at 
https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The directory and project were created successfully. Now I need to modify the `src/main.rs` file to contain the "Hello, world!" program. I'll use the `save` tool for this.
</thinking>

```save hello_world/src/main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.

Saving to hello_world/src/main.rs
System: Saved to hello_world/src/main.rs
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The `main.rs` file has been updated. Now I need to build the project and run the resulting binary. I'll use the `shell` tool again.
</thinking>

```bash
cd hello_world && cargo build && ./target/debug/hello_world
```                                                                                Hello, world!

System: 
Ran command: `cd hello_world && cargo build && ./target/debug/hello_world`

stdout: `Hello, world!`

stderr:
```
