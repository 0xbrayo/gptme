User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

I'll write a Python script that finds the 100th prime number. I'll use a simple but efficient approach:
1. Write a function to check if a number is prime
2. Write a function to find the nth prime number
3. Use it to find the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")
```

Let's run it to verify:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
