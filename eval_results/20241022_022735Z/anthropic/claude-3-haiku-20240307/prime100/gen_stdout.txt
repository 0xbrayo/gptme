User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Okay, let's write a script to compute and print the 100th prime number. Here's how we can do it:

<thinking>
To find the 100th prime number, we need to implement a function that can efficiently generate prime numbers up to a certain limit. The most straightforward approach is to use the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is a well-known method for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.

The steps to solve this problem are:
1. Implement a function to generate prime numbers up to a given limit using the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
2. Call this function to find the 100th prime number and print the result.
</thinking>

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def get_nth_prime(n):
    primes = []
    i = 2
    while len(primes) < n:
        if is_prime(i):
            primes.append(i)
        i += 1
    return primes[-1]

print(get_nth_prime(100))
```

Let's break down the code:

1. The `is_prime` function checks if a given number `n` is prime by checking if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n`.
2. The `get_nth_prime` function generates prime numbers starting from 2 until it has found the `n`th prime number. It uses the `is_prime` function to check if each number is prime, and appends it to the `primes` list if it is. Finally, it returns the last element in the `primes` list, which is the `n`th prime number.
3. The script calls `get_nth_prime(100)` to find the 100th prime number and prints the result.

To run the script, save it as `prime.py` and execute it with Python:

```
python prime.py
```

The output should be the 100th prime number, which is 541.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
