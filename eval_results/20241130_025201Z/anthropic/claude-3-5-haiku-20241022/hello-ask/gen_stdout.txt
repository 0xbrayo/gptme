User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

```shell
cat hello.py
```
                                                                                


name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`


```stdout
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

The patch was successfully applied. The file now:
1. Uses `input()` to prompt the user for their name
2. Stores the name in a variable
3. Uses an f-string to print a personalized greeting
4. Replaces the original "Hello, world!" message
</thinking>

The modification looks correct. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
