User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
To find the 100th prime number, we need to write a script that can check if a number is prime and then use this function to find the 100th prime.

We'll start by creating a function `is_prime(n)` that checks if a number `n` is prime. This function will return `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise.

Next, we'll create a function `nth_prime(n)` that uses the `is_prime(n)` function to find the nth prime number.

Finally, we'll call `nth_prime(100)` to find the 100th prime number and print the result.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(nth_prime(100))
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Saving to prime.py
System: Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
Now that we have the script saved to `prime.py`, we can run it using the `python` command to find and print the 100th prime number.
</thinking>

```shell
python prime.py
```                                                                                
541

System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

 `541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

The 100th prime number is 541. Is there anything else I can help you with?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
