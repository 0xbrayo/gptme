User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll use a simple algorithm to find prime numbers:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Iterate through numbers, keeping track of how many primes we've found
3. Stop and print when we reach the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```

Now, I'll run the script to verify:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

<thinking>          <thinking>
The script does the following:
- `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
- `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it finds the nth prime
- Prints the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

The script efficiently finds the 100th prime number by checking primality and keeping a count of primes found. The algorithm is straightforward and should work correctly.

Would you like me to explain the approach or verify the result?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
