1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file
2. The patch tool is perfect for this small change
3. I'll replace the simple print with input() and an f-string
4. Since I can see the current content, I can create a precise patch

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
