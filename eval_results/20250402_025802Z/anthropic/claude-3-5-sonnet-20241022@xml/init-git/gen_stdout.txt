User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it

Let's break this down into steps:
1. Initialize git repo
2. Create main.py with some basic content
3. Add and commit the file
</thinking>           </thinking>

First, let's initialize the git repository:
```shell
git init
```

Now, let's create a basic main.py file:
```save main.py
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Let's add and commit the file:
```shell
git add main.py
git commit -m "Initial commit with main.py"
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
