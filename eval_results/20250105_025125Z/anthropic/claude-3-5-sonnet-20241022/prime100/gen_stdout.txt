User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")
```

    if n < 2:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script worked correctly! It found that the 100th prime number is 541. 

We can verify this is correct by checking that:
1. 541 is indeed prime (it is)
2. It's preceded by exactly 99 other prime numbers

The algorithm is efficient enough for this case since we only needed to find the 100th prime. For much larger numbers, we might want to use more efficient methods like the Sieve of Eratosthenes, but for this purpose, the simple trial division approach works well.

Would you like me to modify the script in any way?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
