User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll write a Python script that finds the 100th prime number. I'll use the save tool to create prime.py.
The script will need:
1. A function to check if a number is prime
2. A loop to find the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {find_nth_prime(100)}")
```

<thinking>          <thinking>
Now we can run the script to verify it works:
</thinking>           </thinking>

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

The script will find the 100th prime number by:
1. Using is_prime() to check each number for primality
2. Using find_nth_prime() to count prime numbers until we reach the 100th one
3. Printing the result                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
