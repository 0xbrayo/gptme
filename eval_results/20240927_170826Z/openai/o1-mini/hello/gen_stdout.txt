User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
To create a Python script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!", I'll use
the `save` tool to write the necessary code to the file.
</thinking>
```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Skipping confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The `hello.py` script has been successfully saved. To ensure it works as 
expected, I'll execute the script using Python.
</thinking>
To run the script, use the following command:
```bash
python hello.py
```

Hello, world!

System: 
Ran command: `python hello.py`

stdout: `Hello, world!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The `hello.py` script executed successfully, printing "Hello, world!" to the 
console. Everything is working as expected. If you'd like to expand on this 
script or need assistance with another task, feel free to let me know!
</thinking>
 
Is there anything else you'd like to do?
