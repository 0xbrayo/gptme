User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Here is a Python script that computes and prints the 100th prime number:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        num += 1
    return num - 1

print(nth_prime(100))
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.

```bash
python prime.py
```

System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

stdout: `541`
