Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Here is the patch to change the greeting to "Hello, human!":

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The system applied my patch successfully, but noted that the patch was larger than the file itself. In this case, it would have been more efficient to use the save tool to overwrite the entire file contents, rather than using a patch.
</thinking>

You're right, since the patch ended up being larger than the file, I should have used the save tool instead. Here is the corrected code using save:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great, the code has been updated successfully using the save tool. Let me know if there are any other changes you would like me to make to the code.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
