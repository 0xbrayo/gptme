Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

To patch the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", I will use the patch tool.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                
Preview
-print("Hello, world!")                                                         
+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The patch was successfully applied to `hello.py`. The file should now print "Hello, human!" when executed.

To verify, I can use the shell tool to run the script:

```shell
python hello.py
```                                                                                

Preview
python hello.py                                                                 

Hello, human!

System: 
Ran command: `python hello.py`

 `Hello, human!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The patch was applied correctly, and the script now prints "Hello, human!".
