User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll create a script that finds the 100th prime number. I'll use a simple approach to check for primes.

Let me write the script and then execute it.

It seems there's a permission issue. Let me try checking what's in the /app directory and see if I can write to it, or maybe I need to use a different approach.

Let me first check the current working directory and permissions.

Ah, the working directory is actually `/home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-01-17-gptme-evals-anthropic--claude-haiku-4-5-xml-85caddaf/workspace`, not `/app`. The system information said `/app` but that's just the default. Let me save the file to the actual current working directory.
