It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from writing to the `/app` directory. You might need to adjust the permissions or choose a different directory where I can save the file. Alternatively, you can create the file manually with the following content:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Let me know how you would like to proceed!                                                                                [03:18:24] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 790 context | 0% cached
