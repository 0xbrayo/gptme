It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the `/app` directory. Let's first check the current directory structure to locate the file. Could you please list the files in the current directory? You can do this by running the command:

```bash
ls -R /app
```                                                                                [03:18:25] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 1k context | 46% cached
