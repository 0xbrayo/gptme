modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```hello.py

```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Certainly! I'll provide a patch to modify the `hello.py` file to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
