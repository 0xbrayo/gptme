User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let's start by initializing a git repository, creating a `main.py` file, and then committing it. Here are the steps:

1. Initialize a git repository.
2. Create a `main.py` file with some content.
3. Add the file to the staging area.
4. Commit the file to the repository.

I'll execute these steps for you. Let's begin by initializing the git repository. 

```shell
git init
```

git init

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The git repository has been initialized. Now, let's create the `main.py` file with some initial content. I'll write a simple "Hello, World!" program.

```save /app/main.py
print("Hello, World!")
```
                                                                                
Preview
print("Hello, World!")                                                          

System: ❌ Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/main.py'

It seems there is a permission issue when trying to create the `main.py` file in the `/app` directory. Let's check the current working directory and try creating the file in a location where we have write permissions. 

```shell
pwd
```                                                                                /home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-01-21-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-4o-markdown-00414abd/workspace

The current working directory is `/home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-01-21-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-4o-markdown-00414abd/workspace`. Let's create the `main.py` file in this directory instead.

```save /home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-01-21-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-4o-markdown-00414abd/workspace/main.py
print("Hello, World!")
```

The `main.py` file has been created successfully. Now, let's add this file to the staging area and commit it to the repository.

```shell
git add main.py
