The user wants me to modify hello.py to:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!'

I can use the patch tool to make this change. The current file contains:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Let me apply a patch to modify this file.

Done! The file now asks for the user's name and prints "Hello, <name>!" Let me verify it works:
