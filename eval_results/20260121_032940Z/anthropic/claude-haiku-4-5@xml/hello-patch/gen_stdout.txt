Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a straightforward task where I need to use the patch tool to modify the file.

I'll apply a patch to change the string from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
