The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")

The file has been successfully saved. The user's task is complete. I should let them know it's done. They can now run it if they want to verify it works.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a print statement that outputs "Hello, world!". You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:29:18] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
