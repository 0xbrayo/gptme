Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.

<thinking> 
Oops! You're right. Since the entire file needs to be changed, using `save` is more appropriate. 
</thinking> 

```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!") 
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.

Great! Now if you run `python hello.py`, it should print "Hello, human!".
