Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.

The system applied my patch successfully to hello.py to change the greeting. However, it noted that the patch was larger than the file itself. In this case, it would have been more efficient to use the save tool to overwrite the entire file contents rather than applying a patch.
</thinking>

You're right, since the patch ended up being the entire file contents, I should have used the save tool instead. Here is the corrected code using save:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
