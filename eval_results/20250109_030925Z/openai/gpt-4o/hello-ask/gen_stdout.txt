Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: To modify `hello.py` to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, we can update the script as follows:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Let's apply this change to the file.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
