This is a simple task that requires creating a new Python file with a basic print statement.
I'll use the save tool to write the file.
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

Let's verify the content was saved correctly by reading it back.
</thinking>           </thinking>

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
