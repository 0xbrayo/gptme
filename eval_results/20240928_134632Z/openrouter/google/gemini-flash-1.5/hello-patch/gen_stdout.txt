Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py

```

<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.

The feedback is correct.  My previous response used `patch` even though the change was a complete replacement of the file's content.  For such cases, `save` is more appropriate and efficient.  I should have analyzed the size of the patch relative to the original file before choosing the tool.

You are right, my apologies.  Using `patch` for a complete replacement was inefficient.  Here's the corrected approach using `save`:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
