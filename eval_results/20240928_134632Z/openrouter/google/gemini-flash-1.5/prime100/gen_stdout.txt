User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
I need to write a Python script named `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number.  I'll use a simple approach: iterating through numbers, checking for primality, and counting until I reach the 100th prime.  I'll need a function to check if a number is prime.
</thinking>

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Checks if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
