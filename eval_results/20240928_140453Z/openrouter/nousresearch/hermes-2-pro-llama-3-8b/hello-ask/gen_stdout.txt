Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: To modify `hello.py` to ask the user for their name and print "Hello, <name>!", please follow these steps:

1. Open `hello.py` file.
2. Replace the existing print statement with the following code:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Now, the modified `hello.py` file will ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. To execute the modified script, you can use the following command:

```bash
python hello.py
```
