The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

The file has been successfully saved. The user asked me to write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!" and it's done. I should let them know it's ready, and offer to run it if they'd like to verify it works.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script has been created. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [03:22:50] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
