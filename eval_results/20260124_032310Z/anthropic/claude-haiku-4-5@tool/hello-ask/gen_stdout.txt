<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name.

I have the current content of hello.py:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

Done! I've updated `hello.py` to ask for the user's name and greet them with it. The script now uses `input()` to get the name and prints a personalized greeting using an f-string.                                                                                [03:22:51] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 3k context | 0% cached
