It seems there was an issue with the file path. Let's first check the current working directory to ensure we have the correct path to `hello.py`. Then, I will apply the patch again. Let me check the current directory.                                                                                [03:22:36] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 971 context | 0% cached
