User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Now, let's run the script to find the 100th prime number:

```python
python prime.py
```

<thinking>
I'll execute the Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.
The script uses two functions:
1. `is_prime(n)`: Checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime(n)`: Finds the nth prime number by counting primes
