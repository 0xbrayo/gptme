Let's create a Python script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!". 

Here's the content for the script:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I'll save this content to `hello.py`.
@save(call_Wf3VFDPt1uq6MEYAQ5BcvMyD): {"path":"hello.py","content":"print(\"Hello, world!\")"}

print("Hello, world!")
