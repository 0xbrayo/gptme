User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll use the following approach:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Save the script to prime.py
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    primes_found = 0
    current_number = 2
    
    while primes_found < n:
        if is_prime(current_number):
            primes_found += 1
            if primes_found == n:
                return current_number
        current_number += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```

Now, I'll verify the script by running it:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

<thinking>          <thinking>
The script does the following:
1. `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it finds the nth prime
3. Prints the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

The script is now saved as `prime.py` and should compute and print the 100th prime number when executed. Would you like me to explain the algorithm or verify the result?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
