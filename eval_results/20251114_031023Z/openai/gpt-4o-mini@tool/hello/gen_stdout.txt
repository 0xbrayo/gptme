Let's create a Python script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!". 

Here is the content for the script:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I'll save this content to `hello.py`. 

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
