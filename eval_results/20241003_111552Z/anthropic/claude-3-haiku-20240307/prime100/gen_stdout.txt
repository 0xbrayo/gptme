User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Okay, let's write a script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>
To do this, we'll need to implement a function that checks if a number is prime, and then use that function to find the 100th prime number.

The key steps will be:
1. Define a is_prime function that checks if a given number is prime
2. Use a loop to find the 100th prime number by checking numbers in order until we've found 100 primes
3. Print the 100th prime number
</thinking>

Here's the code for `prime.py`:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Checks if a number is prime.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to check.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if n is prime, False otherwise.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    """
    Finds the nth prime number.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The index of the prime number to find (1-indexed).
        
    Returns:
        int: The nth prime number.
    """
    primes = []
    num = 2
    while len(primes) < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            primes.append(num)
        num += 1
    return primes[-1]

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(find_nth_prime(100))
```

To run this script, save it to a file named `prime.py` and execute it with Python:

```
python prime.py
```

This will output the 100th prime number, which is 541.

Let me know if you have any other questions!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
