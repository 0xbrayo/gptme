Here's the patch to modify `hello.py` to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting:

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
