User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll use the `patch` tool to modify the `hello.py` file:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

This patch replaces the original print statement with code that:
1. Prompts the user to enter their name using `input()`
2. Stores the name in a variable
3. Prints a personalized greeting using an f-string

The modification adds interactivity to the script by asking for the user's name and then greeting them specifically.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
