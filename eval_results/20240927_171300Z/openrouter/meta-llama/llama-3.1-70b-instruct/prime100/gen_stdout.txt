User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: To write a script that computes and prints the 100th prime number, we can use a simple algorithm that checks each number to see if it's prime, and then stops when it finds the 100th prime.

Here's a Python script that does this:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

print(nth_prime(100))
```
Let's save this to a file named `prime.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
