User:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll keep that in mind for future modifications. Since the patch was larger than the file, it would have been more efficient to use the `save` tool instead. Thank you for the feedback!



Let me try again using the `save` tool to make the same modification.
```save hello.py
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
