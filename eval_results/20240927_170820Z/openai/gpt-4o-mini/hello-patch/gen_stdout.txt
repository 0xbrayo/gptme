Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Let's patch the `hello.py` file to change the print statement to "Hello, human!".

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: It seems the patch was too large for the file, which indicates that the entire file was replaced instead of just modifying the specific line. Let's use the `save` tool to rewrite the entire `hello.py` file with the new content.

Hereâ€™s the updated content for `hello.py`:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The `hello.py` file has been successfully updated to print "Hello, human!".
