Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: ```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Noted. Let's verify the contents of `hello.py` to ensure the patch was applied correctly.

```bash
cat hello.py
```                                                                                
print("Hello, human!")
System: 
Ran command: `cat hello.py`

stdout: `print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The patch was applied successfully, and the file now prints "Hello, human!".
