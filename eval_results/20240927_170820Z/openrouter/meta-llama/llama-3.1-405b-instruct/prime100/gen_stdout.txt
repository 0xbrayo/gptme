User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: To compute the 100th prime number, we can write a Python script that uses a function to check if a number is prime and then iterates through numbers until it finds the 100th prime.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Compute and print the 100th prime number
prime_100 = nth_prime(100)
print(prime_100)
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Saving to prime.py
System: Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

Now that we have the script saved, let's run it using the Python interpreter to find the 100th prime number.

```bash
python prime.py
```                                                                                
541

System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

stdout: `541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The 100th prime number is 541.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
