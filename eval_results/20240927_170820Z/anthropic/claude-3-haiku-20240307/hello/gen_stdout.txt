```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great, the `hello.py` script has been saved. Let's verify the contents:

```bash
cat hello.py
```                                                                                
print("Hello, world!")

We've successfully created the script as requested.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
