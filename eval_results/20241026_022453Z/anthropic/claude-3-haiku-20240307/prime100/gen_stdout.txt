User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Okay, let's write a script to compute and print the 100th prime number. Here's how we can do it:

<thinking>
To find the 100th prime number, we need to implement a function that can efficiently generate prime numbers up to a certain limit. The most straightforward approach is to use the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is an efficient way to find all prime numbers up to a given limit.

The steps to solve this problem are:
1. Implement a function to generate prime numbers up to a given limit using the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
2. Call this function to find the 100th prime number and print it.
</thinking>

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def get_primes(limit):
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, limit + 1):
        if is_prime(i):
            primes.append(i)
    return primes

# Find the 100th prime number
primes = get_primes(1000)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {primes[99]}")
```

Let's break down the code:

1. The `is_prime` function checks if a given number `n` is prime by checking if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n`.
2. The `get_primes` function uses the `is_prime` function to generate a list of prime numbers up to the given `limit`.
3. We call `get_primes` with a limit of 1000 (which is more than enough to find the 100th prime number) and then print the 100th element of the resulting list.

When you run this script, it should output:

```
The 100th prime number is: 541
```

Let me know if you have any other questions!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
