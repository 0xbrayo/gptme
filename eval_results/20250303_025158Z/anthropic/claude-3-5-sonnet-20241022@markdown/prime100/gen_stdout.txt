User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")
```

    if n < 2:                                                                   
        return False                                                            
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):                                       
        if n % i == 0:

def nth_prime(n):                                                               
    count = 0

    while count < n:                                                            
        num += 1

            count += 1

    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")                       

System: âœ… Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let's run the script to see the result:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script successfully found that the 100th prime number is 541. 

We can verify this is correct by:
1. Confirming 541 is prime (it is)
2. Counting that it's indeed the 100th prime number

The sequence of first few prime numbers is: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ... , 541

The script uses an efficient approach by:
- Using square root in the primality test to reduce iterations
- Only testing divisibility up to sqrt(n)
- Incrementing numbers sequentially and keeping count

Would you like to modify the script in any way, such as making it find a different nth prime or making it more efficient?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
