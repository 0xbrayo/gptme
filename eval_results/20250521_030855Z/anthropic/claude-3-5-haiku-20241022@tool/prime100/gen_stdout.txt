User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll create a function that:
1. Checks if a number is prime
2. Finds the 100th prime number
3. Prints the result
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```

Now, I'll run the script to verify the result:

```shell
python prime.py
```

<thinking>          <thinking>
The script does the following:
- `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
- `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
- Prints the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

The script efficiently finds the 100th prime number by:
1. Using an optimized primality test (checking divisors up to square root)
2. Incrementally counting prime numbers
3. Stopping when the 100th prime is found

Would you like me to explain the algorithm or make any modifications to the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
