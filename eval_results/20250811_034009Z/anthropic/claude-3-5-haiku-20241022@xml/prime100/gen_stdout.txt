User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll use a simple algorithm to find prime numbers:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Iterate through numbers, keeping track of how many primes we've found
3. Stop and print when we reach the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(find_nth_prime(100))
```

Now, I'll run the script to verify it works:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

<thinking>          <thinking>
The script uses an efficient approach:
- `is_prime()` checks primality by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number
- `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
- It will print the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

Let me explain the key parts:
1. `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility
2. `find_nth_prime()` keeps track of how many primes we've found
3. The script will find and print the 100th prime number

Would you like me to explain the algorithm in more detail or make any modifications?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
