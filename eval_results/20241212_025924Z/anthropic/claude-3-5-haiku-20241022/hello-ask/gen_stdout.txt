```patch hello.py

print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

1. Prompt the user to enter their name
2. Store the name in the `name` variable
3. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

Would you like me to show you the contents of the file to confirm the changes?                                                                                [02:58:50] Tokens: 2972/67 in/out (session: 5878/127, turns: 2)
