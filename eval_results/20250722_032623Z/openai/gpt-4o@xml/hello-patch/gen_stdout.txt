Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll apply a patch to the file. Here is the patch:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
