User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
1. We need a function to check if a number is prime
2. Then we'll count primes until we reach the 100th one
3. We'll use a simple but efficient approach by checking divisibility up to sqrt(n)
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = nth_prime(100)
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {result}")
```

Let's run it to verify:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

The script will find the 100th prime number. The algorithm:
1. `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `nth_prime()` counts prime numbers until it reaches the nth one
3. The main block calls `nth_prime(100)` and prints the result                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
