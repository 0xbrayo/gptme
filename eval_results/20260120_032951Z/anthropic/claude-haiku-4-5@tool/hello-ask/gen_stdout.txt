<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print it. Currently it just prints "Hello, world!". I need to:
1. Ask for user input
2. Store the name
3. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I should use the patch tool to make this modification.

Done! I've modified hello.py to ask for the user's name and greet them with it. The script now:
1. Prompts the user with "What is your name? "
2. Stores their input in the `name` variable
3. Prints "Hello, {name}!"                                                                                [03:29:32] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 3k context | 0% cached
