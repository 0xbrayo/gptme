Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple patch task.

I need to use the patch tool to modify the file. The original line is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And it should be changed to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

Let me apply this patch.
