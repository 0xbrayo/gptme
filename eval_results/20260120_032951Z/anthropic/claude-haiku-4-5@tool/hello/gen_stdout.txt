User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the appropriate content.

System: ❌ Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'

There's a permission denied error. Let me try with a relative path instead, since the current working directory is /app. The save tool says "The path can be relative to the current directory, or absolute. If the current directory changes, the path will be relative to the new directory." So I should try using just "hello.py" as a relative path.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the content `print("Hello, world!")`. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:29:32] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
