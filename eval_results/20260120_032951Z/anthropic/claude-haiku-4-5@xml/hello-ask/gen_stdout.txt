The user wants me to modify hello.py to:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' with the user's input

I'll use the patch tool to make this change. The current file prints "Hello, world!", and I need to modify it to ask for input and print a personalized greeting.

Let me use the patch tool to update the file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>

The patch was successfully applied! The user's hello.py file has been modified to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

The task is complete.

Done! The file now asks for the user's name and greets them with a personalized message.                                                                                [03:29:33] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
