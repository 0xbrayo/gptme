Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. The original line is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And it should be changed to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

This is a simple one-line change.
