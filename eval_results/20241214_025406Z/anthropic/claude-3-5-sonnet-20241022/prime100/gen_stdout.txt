User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")
```

The 100th prime number is: 541

System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script worked correctly! It found that the 100th prime number is 541.

To verify this is correct:
1. We can check that 541 is indeed prime (our is_prime() function does this)
2. We can cross-reference with known lists of prime numbers

Let me verify this with a quick Python check:

```python
# Verify 541 is prime
all(541 % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(541**0.5) + 1))
```                                                                                [02:54:02] Tokens: 3067/105 in/out (session: 8970/270, turns: 3)
