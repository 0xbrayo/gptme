User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 100
    result = nth_prime(n)
    print(f"The {n}th prime number is: {result}")
```

    if n < 2:

    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):

def nth_prime(n):                                                               
    count = 0

Let's run the script to see the result:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script has successfully computed that the 100th prime number is 541. The script is working as intended, using an efficient implementation with:

1. A prime checking function using trial division up to the square root
2. A counter to find the nth prime
3. Clear output formatting

Would you like to make any modifications to the script or verify the result in some way?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
