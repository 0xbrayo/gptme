Let me break this down into steps:
1. First, I'll initialize a git repository
2. Then create a basic main.py file
3. Finally, add and commit the file

Let's execute these steps:

```shell
git init
```

Now, let's create a basic main.py file:

```save main.py
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now let's add and commit the file:

```shell
git add main.py && git commit -m "Initial commit: Add main.py"
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
