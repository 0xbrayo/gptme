It seems there was an issue with saving the file. Let me try that again.

I encountered an issue while trying to save the file. Let me try a different approach.
@save(call_vRTUg2NuSSyNP4Vw0k2Z9fMa): {"path":"main.py","content":"print(\"Hello, World!\")"}                                                                                System: No content provided
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I am unable to save the file at the moment. Could you please try saving the following content to `main.py` manually?

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Once you've done that, let me know, and we can proceed with committing the file.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
