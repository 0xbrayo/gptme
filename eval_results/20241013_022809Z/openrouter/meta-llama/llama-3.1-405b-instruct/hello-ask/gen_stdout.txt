```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

-print("Hello, world!")                                                         
+name = input("What is your name? ")                                            
+print(f"Hello, {name}!")

The file now asks the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting. If you'd like to verify the changes, I can use the `read` tool to display the updated contents of `hello.py`. 

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
System: 
Ran command: `cat hello.py`


```stdout
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
