It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from saving the file in the `/app` directory. 

Let's try saving the script in a different directory where I have write permissions. Could you please let me know a suitable directory, or if you can adjust the permissions for the `/app` directory?                                                                                [03:45:16] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 802 context | 0% cached
