<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print a greeting with that name. I should use the patch tool to make this change.

Current content:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

Desired behavior:
- Ask user for their name
- Print "Hello, <name>!"

I'll use the patch tool to replace the single print statement with code that asks for the name and prints the greeting.

Done! The script now asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:45:27] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 3k context | 0% cached
