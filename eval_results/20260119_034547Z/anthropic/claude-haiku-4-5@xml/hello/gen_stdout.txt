User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a file called hello.py in the current directory (/app) with the appropriate print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been saved successfully. The user can now run it if they want to verify it works. I should let them know it's ready and maybe suggest they can run it.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [03:45:25] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 974 context | 0% cached
