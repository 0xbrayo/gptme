I'll use the save tool to create a new Python script that prints "Hello, world!".
The request is straightforward and I have all the information needed:
- filename: hello.py
- content: a print statement with the exact text "Hello, world!"
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
