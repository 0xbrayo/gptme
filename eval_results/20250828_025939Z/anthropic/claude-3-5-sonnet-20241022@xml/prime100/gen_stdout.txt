User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
1. We need a function to check if a number is prime
2. Then we'll count primes until we find the 100th one
3. We'll use a simple but efficient approach by:
   - Only checking divisors up to sqrt(n)
   - Only checking odd numbers after 2
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    
    # Only check odd divisors up to sqrt(n)
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(nth_prime(100))
```

Let's run it to verify:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

The script will output the 100th prime number. The algorithm is efficient enough for this purpose since we only need the 100th prime number. We optimize by:
1. Only checking odd numbers after 2
2. Only testing divisors up to the square root
3. Only using odd divisors for testing                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
