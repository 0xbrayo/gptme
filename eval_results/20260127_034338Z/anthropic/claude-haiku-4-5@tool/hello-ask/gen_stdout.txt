<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and then print 'Hello, <name>!'. 

I have the current content of hello.py which is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' with the entered name

I can use the patch tool to make this modification.
