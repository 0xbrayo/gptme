The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I just need to create a file called hello.py with a print statement.

I'll use the save tool to create this file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user's request is complete. I should confirm this and let them know they can run it if they want.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created and will print "Hello, world!" when you run it:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [03:43:11] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 974 context | 0% cached
