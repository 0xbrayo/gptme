It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from saving the file in the `/app` directory. 

You can try running the following command in your terminal to change the permissions of the directory, or you can specify a different directory where you have write access:

```bash
chmod u+w /app
```

Alternatively, let me know if there's another directory where you'd like to save the script.                                                                                [03:43:02] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 802 context | 0% cached
