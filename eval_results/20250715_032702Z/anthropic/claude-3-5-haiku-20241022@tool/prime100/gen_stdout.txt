User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll use the following approach:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Save the script to prime.py
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    primes_found = 0
    current_number = 2
    
    while primes_found < n:
        if is_prime(current_number):
            primes_found += 1
            if primes_found == n:
                return current_number
        current_number += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```

Now, I'll verify the script by running it:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll explain the script briefly:
- `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
- `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it finds the nth prime
- The script will find and print the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

The script does the following:
1. Defines a function to check if a number is prime
2. Defines a function to find the nth prime number
3. Finds and prints the 100th prime number

Would you like me to explain the implementation or run the script to show the result?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
