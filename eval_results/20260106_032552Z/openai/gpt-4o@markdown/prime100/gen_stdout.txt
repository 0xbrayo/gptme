User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To compute the 100th prime number, we can use a simple algorithm that checks each number for primality and counts the primes until we reach the 100th one. Let's write the script `prime.py` to achieve this.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
