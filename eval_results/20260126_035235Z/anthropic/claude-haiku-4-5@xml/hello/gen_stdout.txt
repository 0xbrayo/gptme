User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a file called hello.py with the appropriate print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!" and that's been done. I should confirm this is complete. Since the user prefers concise responses and doesn't want explanations of basic concepts, I'll keep my response brief.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:52:17] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 966 context | 0% cached
