User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
1. We need a function to check if a number is prime
2. Then we'll count primes until we find the 100th one
3. We'll use a simple but efficient approach by:
   - Only checking divisors up to sqrt(n)
   - Only checking odd numbers after 2
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    
    # Check odd divisors up to sqrt(n)
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    if n < 1:
        return None
    
    count = 0
    num = 1
    
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
result = nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {result}")
```

Let's run it to verify:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

The script should find and print the 100th prime number. The algorithm is reasonably efficient for this purpose since:
1. It only checks odd numbers after 2
2. For each number, it only checks divisors up to its square root
3. It only checks odd divisors

Would you like me to add any improvements or optimizations to the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
