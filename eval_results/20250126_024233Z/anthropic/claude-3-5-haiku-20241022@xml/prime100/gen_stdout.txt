User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(find_nth_prime(100))
```

    if n < 2:                                                                   
        return False                                                            
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):                                         
        if n % i == 0:

def find_nth_prime(n):                                                          
    count = 0

        if is_prime(num):                                                       
            count += 1

            return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number                                         
print(find_nth_prime(100))                                                      

System: Saved to prime.py

```shell
python3 prime.py
```
                                                                                
Preview
python3 prime.py                                                                

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script successfully computed the 100th prime number, which is 541. 

Let me break down how the script works:
1. `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime(n)` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
3. We called `find_nth_prime(100)` to get the 100th prime number

Would you like me to explain the algorithm in more detail or modify the script in any way?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
