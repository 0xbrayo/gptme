User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 100
    result = nth_prime(n)
    print(f"The {n}th prime number is: {result}")
```

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script worked correctly! It found that the 100th prime number is 541. 

We can verify this is correct by checking that:
1. 541 is indeed prime
2. There are exactly 99 prime numbers before it

The implementation is efficient enough for this case, using trial division up to the square root of each number being tested. If you needed to find much larger prime numbers, we could optimize it further using techniques like the Sieve of Eratosthenes, but for the 100th prime this simple approach works well.

Would you like me to modify the script in any way?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
