The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

The file has been saved successfully. The user's task is complete. They now have a hello.py script that prints "Hello, world!". I should confirm this is done and offer to help if they want to run it or do anything else with it.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created with the print statement. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [04:26:09] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 957 context | 0% cached
