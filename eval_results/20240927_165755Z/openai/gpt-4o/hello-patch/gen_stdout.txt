User: 
Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Sure! I'll patch the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Noted. I'll use the save tool for future changes if the patch is larger than the file. 

Is there anything else you would like to modify or add to `hello.py`?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
