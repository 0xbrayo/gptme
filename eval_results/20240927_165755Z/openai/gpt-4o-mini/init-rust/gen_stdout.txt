User: create a Rust project in a hello_world directory, write a hello world 
program (that doesnt take input), build it to a binary called `hello_world`, and
run it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
To create a Rust project that prints "Hello, world!" and build it into a binary named `hello_world`, I will follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory called `hello_world`.
2. Initialize a new Rust project in that directory using `cargo`.
3. Write a simple Rust program that prints "Hello, world!".
4. Build the project to create the binary.
5. Run the binary.

Let's start by creating the directory and initializing the Rust project.
</thinking>

```bash
mkdir hello_world
cd hello_world
cargo init --bin
```

```bash
mkdir hello_world
cd hello_world
cargo init --bin

The Rust project has been successfully initialized in the `hello_world` directory. Now, I need to write a simple Rust program that prints "Hello, world!" in the `src/main.rs` file. After that, I will build the project to create the binary and run it.
</thinking>

```save src/main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.

The "Hello, world!" program has been written to `src/main.rs`. Now, I will build the project to create the binary named `hello_world` and then run it.
</thinking>

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/hello_world
```                                                                                
Hello, world!

Ran command:
```bash
cargo build --release

Hereâ€™s a summary of what we did:
1. Created a new directory called `hello_world`.
2. Initialized a new Rust project in that directory.
3. Wrote a simple Rust program that prints "Hello, world!".
4. Built the project to create the binary.
5. Ran the binary, which outputted "Hello, world!".
