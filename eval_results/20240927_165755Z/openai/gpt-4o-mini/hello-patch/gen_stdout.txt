Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Let's patch the `hello.py` file to change the print statement to "Hello, human!".

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: It seems that the patch was too large for the file, which indicates that the file might have been modified or that the patching method was not suitable for this case. 

Let's use the `save` tool to directly overwrite the contents of `hello.py` with the new print statement.

```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The file `hello.py` has been successfully updated to print "Hello, human!".
