Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: To find out who the CEO of Superuser Labs is, I'll need to browse their website and look for this information. Let's start by reading the content of their main page.

```ipython
read_url("https://superuserlabs.org/")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation

File /app/gptme/tools/browser.py:116, in read_url(url)
    113 body_html = page.inner_html("body")
    115 # Convert the HTML to Markdown
--> 116 markdown = html_to_markdown(body_html)
    118 return markdown

File /app/gptme/tools/browser.py:152, in html_to_markdown(html)
    149 def html_to_markdown(html):
    150     # check that pandoc is installed
    151     if not shutil.which("pandoc"):
--> 152         raise Exception("Pandoc is not installed. Needed for browsing.")
    154     p = subprocess.Popen(
    155         ["pandoc", "-f", "html", "-t", "markdown"],
    156         stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
    157         stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    158         stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
    159     )
    160     stdout, stderr = p.communicate(input=html.encode())

Exception: Pandoc is not installed. Needed for browsing.
```

Exception during execution on line 152:
  Exception: Pandoc is not installed. Needed for browsing.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I apologize for the error. It seems that the browsing functionality is not available due to Pandoc not being installed. In this case, we'll need to use an alternative method to find the information. Let's try using the search function instead.

```ipython
search("Superuser Labs CEO")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation
