I can use the `browser` tool to search for information about Superuser Labs and find the CEO.  I'll start by reading the Superuser Labs website. If I can't find the information there, I'll use a search engine.

My attempt to use `read_url` failed because pandoc is not installed. I can try searching directly using the `search` tool.
