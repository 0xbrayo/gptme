To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, we can use the `input` function to get the user's name and then print the greeting. Let's update the script accordingly. 

I'll apply the necessary changes to the file.                                                                                [04:03:10] Session: $0.01 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
