User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll create a function that:
1. Checks if a number is prime
2. Generates prime numbers
3. Finds the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    primes_found = 0
    current_number = 2
    
    while True:
        if is_prime(current_number):
            primes_found += 1
            
            if primes_found == n:
                return current_number
        
        current_number += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```

Now, I'll run the script to verify the result:

```shell
python prime.py
```

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll explain the approach:
- `is_prime()` checks primality by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number
- `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it finds the nth prime
- The script will find the 100th prime number and print it
</thinking>           </thinking>

The script does the following:
1. Defines an `is_prime()` function to check if a number is prime
2. Defines a `find_nth_prime()` function to find the nth prime number
3. Finds and prints the 100th prime number

Would you like me to explain the code further or make any modifications?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
