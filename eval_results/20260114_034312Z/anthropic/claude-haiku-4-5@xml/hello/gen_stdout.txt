The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the file.

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

Done! The script `hello.py` is ready. You can run it with `python hello.py` whenever you want.                                                                                [03:42:58] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 957 context | 0% cached
