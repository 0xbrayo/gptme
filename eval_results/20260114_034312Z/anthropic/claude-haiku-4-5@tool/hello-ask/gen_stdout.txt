<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. Currently it just prints "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to make this change. The patch needs to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print "Hello, <name>!" using the provided name

Let me create a patch that replaces the single print statement with an input statement and a modified print statement.
