User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")
```

    if n < 2:                                                                   
        return False                                                            
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):                                       
        if n % i == 0:                                                          
            return False

def nth_prime(n):                                                               
    count = 0

    while count < n:                                                            
        num += 1

System: ✅ Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let's run it to see the result:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script worked correctly! The 100th prime number is indeed 541. 

Would you like me to make any modifications to the script, such as:
- Making it compute primes more efficiently
- Adding ability to find any nth prime via command line argument
- Adding more information like computation time

Or is there something else you'd like to explore?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
