User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: To compute the 100th prime number, we can write a Python script that uses a function to check if a number is prime and then iterates through numbers until it finds the 100th prime.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Compute and print the 100th prime number
prime_100 = nth_prime(100)
print(prime_100)
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Saving to prime.py
System: Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Now that we have the script saved, let's run it using the Python interpreter to find the 100th prime number.

```bash
python prime.py
```                                                                                
541

System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

stdout: `541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The 100th prime number is 541. The script ran successfully and produced the expected output. If you'd like to explore more prime numbers or modify the script in any way, feel free to let me know!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
