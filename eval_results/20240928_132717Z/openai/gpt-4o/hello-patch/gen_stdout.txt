Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Let's patch the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Noted. For future reference, I'll consider using the save tool for such small changes. 

Is there anything else you would like to modify or add to the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
