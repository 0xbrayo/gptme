Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Here is the patch to update the code in hello.py:
```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.

The patch was larger than the file, which means that the patch tool had to rewrite the entire file. In this case, it would have been more efficient to use the save tool instead of patch. I'll keep this in mind for future reference.
</thinking>

In that case, I could have simply used the save tool to overwrite the contents of hello.py:
```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
