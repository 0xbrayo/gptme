```

```bash

We can't install sudo because we don't have permission, and we can't get permission because we don't have sudo. Let's try a different approach. Since we can't install pandoc, we'll have to find another way to get the information about the CEO of Superuser Labs. Let's try searching for it instead. </thinking>

```ipython
search("Superuser Labs CEO")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation
