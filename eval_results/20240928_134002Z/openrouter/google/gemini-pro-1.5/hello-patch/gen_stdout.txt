Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
I need to patch the `hello.py` file to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". I can use the `patch` tool for this.
</thinking>
```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The system pointed out that my patch was larger than the original file.  This is a good point, and using the `save` tool is more efficient in such cases. I'll rewrite the file using `save` instead.
</thinking>
```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The file has been successfully saved.  There's nothing more to do for this task.
</thinking>
OK. The file `hello.py` now prints "Hello, human!".
                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
