User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number. Let's create it step by step.

<thinking>          <thinking>
1. We need a function to check if a number is prime
2. We need to count prime numbers until we reach the 100th one
3. We'll use a simple but efficient approach by checking divisibility up to square root
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {find_nth_prime(100)}")
```

Let's run it to verify:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

The script will find the 100th prime number by:
1. Using `is_prime()` to efficiently check if a number is prime
2. Using `find_nth_prime()` to count up until we find the 100th prime
3. Printing the result

The output shows us the 100th prime number. This implementation is reasonably efficient for finding the 100th prime number, though there are more sophisticated methods for finding large prime numbers.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
