Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
I'll use the patch tool to modify the existing code to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The change is simple - just replacing the text within the print statement.
</thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                


print("Hello, human!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Yes, I can confirm that the file now correctly contains the updated code with "Hello, human!". Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
