Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Let's patch the `hello.py` file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Noted. For future reference, I'll use the save tool for such small changes. Let's verify the content of `hello.py` to ensure the patch was applied correctly.

```bash
cat hello.py
```                                                                                
print("Hello, human!")
System: 
Ran command: `cat hello.py`

stdout: `print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The patch was applied successfully, and the content of `hello.py` is now:

```python
print("Hello, human!")
```
