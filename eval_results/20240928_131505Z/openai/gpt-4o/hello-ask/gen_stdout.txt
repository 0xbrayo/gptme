```patch hello.py

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System:

```save hello.py
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
