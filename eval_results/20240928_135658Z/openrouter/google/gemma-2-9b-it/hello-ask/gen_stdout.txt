Patch applied to hello.py

You are right! It's better to rewrite the whole file when making significant changes. 

```save hello.py
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.

Great! Now you can run `python hello.py` to test it.                                                                                  --- Finished generation ---
