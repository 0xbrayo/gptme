User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

```python
def is_prime(n):
  """Returns True if n is a prime number, False otherwise."""
  if n <= 1:
    return False
  for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
      return False
  return True

count = 0
num = 2
while count < 100:
  if is_prime(num):
    count += 1
    print(num)
  num += 1
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_prime(n)` function:**
   - Takes an integer `n` as input.
   - Returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1 (since 1 is not prime).
   - Iterates from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it's not prime, so it returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding a divisor, `n` is prime, and it returns `True`.

2. **Main loop:**
   - Initializes `count` to 0 (to keep track of prime numbers found) and `num` to 2 (the first prime number).
   - Enters a `while` loop that continues until `count` reaches 100 (meaning we've found 100 primes).
   - Inside the loop:
     - Calls `is_prime(num)` to check if the current `num` is prime.
     - If it's prime:
       - Increments `count`.
       - Prints the prime number `num`.
     - Increments `num` to check the next number.
