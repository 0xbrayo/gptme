Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

You are right!  It's more efficient to rewrite the whole file in this case. 

```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.

Great! Now let's run the updated code. 

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                
Hello, human!

System: 
Ran command: `python hello.py`

stdout: `Hello, human!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

Excellent! It worked as expected.  We successfully updated the code and executed it.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
