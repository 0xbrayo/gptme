User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: ```python
print("Hello, world!")
``` 

I've saved the script to `hello.py`. 

Would you like to execute it?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
