User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 100
    result = nth_prime(n)
    print(f"The {n}th prime number is: {result}")
```

    if n < 2:                                                                   
        return False                                                            
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):                                       
        if n % i == 0:

def nth_prime(n):                                                               
    count = 0                                                                   
    num = 1                                                                     
    while count < n:                                                            
        num += 1                                                                
        if is_prime(num):                                                       
            count += 1                                                          
    return num

    n = 100                                                                     
    result = nth_prime(n)                                                       
    print(f"The {n}th prime number is: {result}")                               

System: ✅ Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let's run the script to see the result:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script worked correctly! The 100th prime number is 541. 

We can verify this is correct by checking that:
1. There are exactly 99 prime numbers before 541
2. 541 is indeed prime

If you'd like to verify the result or make any modifications to the script, just let me know.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
