User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Certainly! Here's a script `prime.py` that computes and prints the 
100th prime number:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

count = 0
num = 1

while count < 100:
    num += 1
    if is_prime(num):
        count += 1

print(num)
```
Skipping confirmation.
Saving to prime.py
System: Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! Now you can run the script to compute and print the 100th 
prime number:

```bash
python3 prime.py
```

This should output:

```stdout
541
```

541

System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

stdout: `541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Excellent! It looks like the script ran successfully and printed the 
100th prime number, which is **541**. If you have any other questions or need 
further assistance with your code, feel free to ask!
