Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Sure, I can help you patch the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, 
human!".

<thinking>
- The original code in `hello.py` is:
  ```python
  print("Hello, world!")
  ```
- I need to change the string from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".
- I'll create a patch using the `patch` tool to modify `hello.py`.
</thinking>

Here is the patch:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'm sorry about that. Since the patch was larger than the file, it's 
better to use the `save` tool to overwrite the file. Here is the updated 
`hello.py`:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```
Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! The `hello.py` file has been updated. Let's run the script to 
see the new output:

```bash
python hello.py
```

Hello, human!

System: 
Ran command: `python hello.py`

stdout: `Hello, human!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
- The user ran the updated `hello.py` script and it printed "Hello, human!".
- This means the modification was successful.
- I should confirm the successful update and offer further assistance if needed.
</thinking>

Great! The script ran successfully and printed **"Hello, human!"**. The 
`hello.py` file has been updated as desired. Let me know if there's anything 
else I can assist you with.
