Let's create a Python script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!". 

Here's the content for the script:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I'll save this to `hello.py`.
@save(call_qj4VPRu4Q7kJL2psdIz5RWiI): {"path":"hello.py","content":"print(\"Hello, world!\")"}

The script `hello.py` has been created and saved. It contains the following code:
