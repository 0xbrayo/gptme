The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the file hello.py with the appropriate print statement.

I got a permission denied error. Let me try with a relative path instead, or check the current working directory. Let me try saving to the current directory with just the filename.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the content that prints "Hello, world!". You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:23:58] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
