Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". I need to use the patch tool to make this change.

I'll use the conflict marker format to patch just the print statement.
