User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll write a simple prime number generator script that finds the 100th prime number.

A straightforward approach:
- Use a helper function to check if a number is prime
- Keep counting primes until we reach the 100th one
- Print the result

Let me write this script and then run it.
