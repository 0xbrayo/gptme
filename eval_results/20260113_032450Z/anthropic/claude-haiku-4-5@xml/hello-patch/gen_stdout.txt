Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple string replacement.

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args="/app/hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

The patch failed because the file doesn't exist at `/app/hello.py`. The current working directory is actually `/home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-01-13-gptme-evals-anthropic--claude-haiku-4-5-xml-f7a6cd46/workspace`.

The user provided the file content inline in their message, but the file doesn't actually exist in the filesystem yet. I need to create it first, or patch it at the correct location relative to the current working directory.

Since the file is in the current working directory (based on the error message showing the pwd), I should create it there first or use a relative path. Let me use the save tool to create the file.
</think>        </think>

I need to create the file first. Let me save it in the current working directory:
<tool-use>
<save args="/home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-01-13-gptme-evals-anthropic--claude-haiku-4-5-xml-f7a6cd46/workspace/hello.py">
print("Hello, human!")
</save>
</tool-use>

Done! The file has been created with the updated content.                                                                                [03:24:03] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
