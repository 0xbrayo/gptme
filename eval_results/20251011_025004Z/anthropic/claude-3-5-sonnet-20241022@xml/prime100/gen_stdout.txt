User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

Let me write a Python script to find the 100th prime number. I'll write a function to check for prime numbers and then use it to find the 100th one.
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")
```

Let's run it to verify:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

<thinking>          <thinking>
The script should efficiently find the 100th prime number. It uses:
1. A simple but effective primality test function
2. A function to find the nth prime number by counting primes
3. Direct output of the 100th prime number
