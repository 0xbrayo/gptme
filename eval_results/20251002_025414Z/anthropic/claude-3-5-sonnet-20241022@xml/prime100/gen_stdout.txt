User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

Let me write a Python script to find the 100th prime number. I'll write a function to check if a number is prime and then use it to find the 100th prime.
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = nth_prime(100)
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {result}")
```

Let's run it to verify:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

The script uses an efficient prime checking function that only checks divisors up to the square root of the number. It then keeps counting prime numbers until it finds the 100th one.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
