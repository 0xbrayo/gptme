1. First, I'll initialize a git repository
2. Then create a basic main.py file
3. Finally, commit the changes
</thinking>           </thinking>

Let's start by initializing the git repository:

```shell
git init
```

Now, let's create a basic main.py file:

```save main.py
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Let's add and commit the file:

```shell
git add main.py
git commit -m "Initial commit with main.py"
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
