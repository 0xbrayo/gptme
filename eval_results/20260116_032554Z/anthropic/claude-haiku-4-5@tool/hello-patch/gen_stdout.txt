User: 
Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. The patch should be minimal and focused on just changing the string being printed.

The file doesn't exist at `/app/hello.py`. The working directory appears to be different. Let me check the current working directory and create the file there, or determine where to create it. Actually, the user provided the file content, so I should create it first or use the correct path. Let me use pwd to see where I am and then either create the file or patch it at the right location.

Looking at the error, the actual pwd is `/home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-01-16-gptme-evals-anthropic--claude-haiku-4-5-tool-89377cff/workspace`. The system info said the working directory is `/app`, but it seems there's a discrepancy. 

I should try patching at the current working directory or ask the user. But since they provided the file content, I could also try creating it first. Let me try patching it in the current directory.
