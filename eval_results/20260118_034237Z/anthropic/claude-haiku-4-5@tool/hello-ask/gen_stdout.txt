The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of the current "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to modify the file. The current content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And I need to change it to:
```
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Let me use the patch tool to make this change.

The file doesn't exist in the current directory. Let me check where I am and create the file with the save tool instead.
