User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"

The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<function_calls>
<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed it was saved to hello.py. I should let the user know it's done, and maybe offer to run it to verify it works.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the code to print "Hello, world!". 

Would you like me to run it to verify it works?                                                                                [03:41:46] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 970 context | 0% cached
