User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll use the `save` tool to create the `hello.py` script:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

Now, let's verify the contents of the file:

```shell
cat hello.py
```

Would you like me to run the script as well?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
