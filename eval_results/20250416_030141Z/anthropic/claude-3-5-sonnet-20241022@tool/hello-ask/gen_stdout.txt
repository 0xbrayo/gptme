1. I need to modify hello.py to add user input and personalized greeting
2. I can use the patch tool since we have the original content
3. The change is simple enough for a single patch block
</thinking>           </thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
