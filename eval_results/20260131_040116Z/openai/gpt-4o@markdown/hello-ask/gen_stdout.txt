To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, we can use the `input` function to get the user's name and then format the output string. Let's apply this change. 

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+name = input("What is your name? ")                                            
+print(f"Hello, {name}!")

It seems there was an issue with applying the patch. Let's first check the current directory to ensure the file path is correct, and then I'll apply the changes directly. 

```shell
pwd
```                                                                                /home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-01-31-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-4o-markdown-8466a05a/workspace

It seems the working directory is not where the `hello.py` file is located. Let's list the files in the current directory to verify the presence of `hello.py`.

```shell
ls
```                                                                                hello.py

Ran allowlisted command: `ls`

`hello.py`

The `hello.py` file is present in the current directory. Let's apply the changes directly to the file.

```patch hello.py
