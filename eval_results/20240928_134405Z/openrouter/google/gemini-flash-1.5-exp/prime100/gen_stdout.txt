User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
We need to write a script that computes the 100th prime number.
We can do this by writing a function that checks if a number is prime, and then iterating through numbers until we find 100 prime numbers.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Checks if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
