```bash
apt-get install pandoc
```

Our current approach to installing pandoc won't work. Since we can't use the `read_url` function, let me try searching for the CEO of Superuser Labs in a different way. I'll search the web for the information instead. </thinking>

```ipython
search(query="Superuser Labs CEO")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation
