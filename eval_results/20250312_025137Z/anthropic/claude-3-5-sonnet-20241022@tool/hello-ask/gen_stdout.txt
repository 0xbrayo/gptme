1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file
2. The patch tool is perfect for this small change
3. I'll replace the simple print with input for name and formatted print
4. No execution is requested, so I'll just make the change

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
