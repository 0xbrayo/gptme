User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
To find the 100th prime number, we need to generate prime numbers until we reach the 100th one. We can use a simple algorithm to check if a number is prime, and keep track of the count of prime numbers found so far.
</thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime"""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number"""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Print the 100th prime number
print(nth_prime(100))
```                                                                                Saving to prime.py
System: Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

Now that we have the script saved, we can run it to find the 100th prime number.
</thinking>

```shell
python prime.py
```

python prime.py

System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`
