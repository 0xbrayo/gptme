Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Okay, let's patch the `hello.py` file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

<thinking>
To do this, I will use the `patch` tool to modify the file in a targeted way, rather than rewriting the entire file. This will allow me to preserve the existing code and comments, and only change the specific line that needs to be updated.
</thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

-print("Hello, world!")                                                         
+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great, the patch has been successfully applied to `hello.py`. Let's verify the updated contents:

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                

Preview
cat hello.py                                                                    

print("Hello, human!")
System: 
Ran command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Excellent, the file now contains the updated code that prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". The patch was applied correctly.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
