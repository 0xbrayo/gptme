User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number

            return False
    return True

    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    candidate = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(candidate):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return candidate
        candidate += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)

```python
with open('prime.py', 'r') as file:
    print(file.read())
```

Now I'll execute the script:

```shell
python prime.py
```
                                                                                [02:58:03] Tokens: 3061/55 in/out (session: 5937/236, turns: 2)

The 100th prime number is: 541

Ran command: `python prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The script worked correctly. Let me break down what the code does:
1. `is_prime()` function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime()` function iterates through numbers, counting primes until it finds the nth prime
3. The script found that the 100th prime number is 541
</thinking>

Would you like me to explain the algorithm or demonstrate how the prime number was found? I can also modify the script to show more details about the prime number generation process if you're interested.                                                                                [02:58:06] Tokens: 3137/119 in/out (session: 9074/355, turns: 3)
