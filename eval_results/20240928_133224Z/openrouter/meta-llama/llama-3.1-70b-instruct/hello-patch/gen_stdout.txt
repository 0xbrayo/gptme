Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Let's patch the code in hello.py.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The patch was larger than the file, which means the file was completely replaced by the patch. In this case, using the save tool would have been a more efficient approach. I'll keep this in mind for future reference.
</thinking>

In hindsight, I could have simply used the save tool to overwrite the contents of hello.py with the new code. Here's an example of how I could have done it:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I've successfully overwrote the contents of hello.py with the updated code using the save tool. The file should now contain the correct code to print "Hello, human!".                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
