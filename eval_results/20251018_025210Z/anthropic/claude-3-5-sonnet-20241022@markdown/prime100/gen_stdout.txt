User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

Let me write a Python script to find the 100th prime number. I'll write a function to check if a number is prime and then use it to find the 100th prime.
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = nth_prime(100)
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {result}")
```

        return False

def nth_prime(n):

        num += 1

System: ✅ Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let's run the script to see the result:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```                                                                                
Preview
python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script has successfully computed that the 100th prime number is 541. 

Would you like me to verify this result or make any modifications to the script? I can also add some optimizations if you'd like to make it run faster, though for finding just the 100th prime number, the current implementation is sufficiently efficient.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
