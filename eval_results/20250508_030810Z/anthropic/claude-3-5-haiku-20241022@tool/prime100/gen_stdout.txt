User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll use a simple algorithm to find prime numbers:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Iterate through numbers, keeping track of how many primes we've found
3. Stop and print when we reach the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(find_nth_prime(100))
```

Now, I'll run the script to verify it works:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll explain the script:
- `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
- `find_nth_prime(n)` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it finds the nth prime
- The script will print the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

The script uses an efficient approach to find the 100th prime number. It systematically checks numbers, incrementing a prime counter, and stops when it finds the 100th prime.

Would you like me to explain the algorithm in more detail or demonstrate how it works?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
