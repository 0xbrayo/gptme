The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. I should use the patch tool to make this change.

The current file prints "Hello, world!" and I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.

Done! The file now asks for the user's name and greets them with it.                                                                                [03:44:41] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
