The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

The file has been saved successfully. The user's task is complete. I should confirm that the script is ready and can be run if they want to test it.

Done! The script `hello.py` is ready. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [03:49:27] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 957 context | 0% cached
