Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch the file `hello.py` to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. The file is at `/app/hello.py` (based on the working directory being `/app`).

I'll use the patch tool with a conflict marker to change the print statement.

It seems the working directory has changed. Let me check where we actually are and create/patch the file at the correct location. The actual working directory seems to be different from `/app` that was mentioned in the system info. Let me work in the current directory.
