It seems there was an issue with the file path when trying to add `main.py` to the git repository. Let's try saving the `main.py` file again with the correct path and then commit it.

It seems there was an issue with saving the file. Let me try that again.

I encountered an issue while trying to save the file. Let me try a different approach to ensure the file is created correctly.

It seems there is a persistent issue with saving the file. Let me try one more time to ensure the file is created correctly.

I am unable to save the file at the moment. Could you please try creating the `main.py` file manually with the following content?

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Once you've done that, let me know, and we can proceed with adding and committing the file to the git repository.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
