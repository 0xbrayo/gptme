User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll use the save tool to write a simple "Hello, world!" script.

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

Let's verify the content:

```shell
cat hello.py
```

Now you can run it with Python if you'd like.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
