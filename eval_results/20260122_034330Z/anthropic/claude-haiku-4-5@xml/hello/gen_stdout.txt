User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a file called hello.py with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user's request is complete. I should confirm that the script has been created and potentially offer to run it if they'd like to verify it works.
</think>        </think>

Done! Created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [03:43:06] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 965 context | 0% cached
