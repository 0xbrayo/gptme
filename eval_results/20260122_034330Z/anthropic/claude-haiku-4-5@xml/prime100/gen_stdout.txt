User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a Python script called `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I should create a script that finds prime numbers and finds the 100th one. I'll use a simple approach to generate primes.

Let me write the script and then run it.
