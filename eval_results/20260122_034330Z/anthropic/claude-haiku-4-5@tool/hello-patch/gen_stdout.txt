Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple string replacement patch.

I need to use the patch tool to change the print statement from `print("Hello, world!")` to `print("Hello, human!")`.
