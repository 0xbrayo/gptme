<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print "Hello, <name>!" instead of just "Hello, world!". 

I can use the patch tool to make this change. The current content prints a static greeting, and I need to:
1. Add an input() call to ask for the user's name
2. Use that name in the print statement with an f-string

Let me create a patch for this.

Done! I've modified `hello.py` to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. Now when you run it, it will prompt for input and display "Hello, <name>!"                                                                                [03:43:06] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 3k context | 0% cached
