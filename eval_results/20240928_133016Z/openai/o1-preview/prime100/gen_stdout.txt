User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Sure! Here's a script that computes and prints the 100th prime 
number, saved to `prime.py`:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return n == 2 or n == 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

count = 0
num = 1
while count < 100:
    num += 1
    if is_prime(num):
        count += 1

print(num)
```
Skipping confirmation.
Saving to prime.py
System: Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
Now that we've saved the script as `prime.py`, the next step is to run it and 
see the result. Since the output is important, I'll provide the command to 
execute the script and wait for the output before proceeding.
</thinking>

To run the script and compute the 100th prime number, use:

```bash
python3 prime.py
```

541

System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

stdout: `541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The script ran and successfully computed the 100th prime number as `541`. This 
matches the known value, so we can confirm that the script is working correctly.
</thinking>

Great! The script has computed the 100th prime number, which is **541**.

Is there anything else I can assist you with?
