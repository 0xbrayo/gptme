1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file
2. The file contains a simple print statement that I need to change
3. I can use the patch tool to modify it
4. The change will add an input() call and use an f-string for the greeting
</thinking>           </thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
