User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To compute the 100th prime number, we can use a simple algorithm that checks each number for primality and counts the primes until we reach the 100th one. Let's write a script `prime.py` to achieve this. 

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    nth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime}")
```

System: ✅ Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script `prime.py` has been created. It defines a function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime and a function `find_nth_prime` to find the nth prime number. The script then computes and prints the 100th prime number. 

You can run the script using the following command:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
