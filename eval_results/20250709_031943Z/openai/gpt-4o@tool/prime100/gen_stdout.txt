User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number

The script `prime.py` has been created. It defines a function to check if a number is prime and another function to find the nth prime number. When executed, it will compute and print the 100th prime number. Would you like to run it to see the result?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
