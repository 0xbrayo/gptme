Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: To patch the code in hello.py, I will use the patch tool. Here is the patch:
```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll keep that in mind for future patches. Since the patch was larger than the file, it would have been more efficient to use the save tool instead. Thank you for the feedback!

In that case, I'll try again using the save tool:
```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
