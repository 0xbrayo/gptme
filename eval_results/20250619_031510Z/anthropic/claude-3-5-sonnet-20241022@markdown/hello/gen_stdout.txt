User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll use the save tool to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!":

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script has been created. You can run it using Python. Let me verify its contents:

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                print("Hello, world!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script has been created correctly with the "Hello, world!" message. You can run it using Python to see the output.

```shell
python3 hello.py
```                                                                                
Preview
python3 hello.py                                                                

Hello, world!
System: 
Ran command: `python3 hello.py`

 `Hello, world!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Perfect! The script works as expected, printing "Hello, world!" to the console.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
