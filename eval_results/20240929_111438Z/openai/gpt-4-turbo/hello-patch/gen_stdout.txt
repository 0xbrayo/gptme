Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Let's update the `hello.py` file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". Here's the patch:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Thank you for the note. For small files or simple changes, using the `save` tool can indeed be more efficient. I'll keep that in mind for future updates. If there's anything else you need, feel free to ask!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
