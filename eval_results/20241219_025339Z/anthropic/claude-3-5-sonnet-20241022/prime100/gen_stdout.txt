User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")
```

```shell
python3 prime.py

                                                                                [02:53:32] Tokens: 3003/19 in/out (session: 5855/166, turns: 2)

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script worked correctly! It found that the 100th prime number is 541. 

We can verify this is correct by checking that:
1. 541 is indeed prime (it is)
2. It's preceded by exactly 99 prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., 523, 541)

Would you like me to add any additional features to the script, such as timing the calculation or allowing the user to input which nth prime they want to find?                                                                                [02:53:35] Tokens: 3044/105 in/out (session: 8899/271, turns: 3)
