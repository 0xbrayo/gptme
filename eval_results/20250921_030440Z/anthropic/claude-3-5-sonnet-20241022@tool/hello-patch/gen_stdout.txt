Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". The file content is simple and I can see both the original and desired content clearly.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
