The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. I can see the current content of hello.py shows it just prints "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to modify this file to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print a greeting with their name

Let me apply a patch to change this.

Done! I've modified hello.py to ask the user for their name and then print a personalized greeting. The script now uses `input()` to get the name and an f-string to format the output.                                                                                [03:28:43] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 3k context | 0% cached
