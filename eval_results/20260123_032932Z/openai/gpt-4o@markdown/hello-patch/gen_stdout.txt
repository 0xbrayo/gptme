Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", I'll create a patch for you. 

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

It seems there was an issue with applying the patch because the file `hello.py` could not be found. Let's first check the current working directory to ensure the file path is correct. Could you please provide the correct path to `hello.py` or confirm its location?                                                                                [03:28:28] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 993 context | 0% cached
