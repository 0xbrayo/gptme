User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 100
    result = nth_prime(n)
    print(f"The {n}th prime number is: {result}")
```

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script worked correctly! It found that the 100th prime number is 541. 

We can verify this is correct by checking that:
1. 541 is indeed prime
2. There are exactly 99 prime numbers before it

The implementation uses a simple but effective approach:
- `is_prime()` checks primality by testing divisibility up to square root
- `nth_prime()` counts primes until it reaches the nth one

Would you like to make any modifications to the script or verify the result in a different way?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
