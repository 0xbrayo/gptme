Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Okay, let's patch the `hello.py` file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

<thinking>
To do this, I will use the `patch` tool to modify the file in a targeted way, rather than rewriting the entire file. This will allow me to make the specific change needed without losing any existing code or comments.
</thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: 
Patch applied to hello.py
Note: The patch was larger than the file. Consider using the save tool instead.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Ah I see, the patch was larger than the entire file. In that case, it's better to just rewrite the file using the `save` tool instead of trying to patch it.

<thinking>
When the patch is larger than the entire file, it's an indication that a full rewrite would be more appropriate. The `save` tool allows me to completely replace the contents of the file, which is a better approach here than trying to apply a partial patch.
</thinking>

```save hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Skipping overwrite confirmation.
Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great, I've updated the `hello.py` file to print "Hello, human!" using the `save` tool. This is a cleaner approach than trying to patch a file that is smaller than the proposed changes. Thank you for the feedback, it will help me improve my file editing skills.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
