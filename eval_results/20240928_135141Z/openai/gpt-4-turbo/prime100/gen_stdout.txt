User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: To create a script named `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number, we'll write a Python function to check if a number is prime and then use it to find the 100th prime.

Here's how we can do it:

1. Define a function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime.
2. Use a loop to find the 100th prime number.
3. Print the 100th prime number.

Let's write the script:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        num += 1
    return num - 1

# Compute and print the 100th prime number
print(find_nth_prime(100))
```                                                                                Skipping confirmation.
Saving to prime.py

You can run this script using Python to see the output.
