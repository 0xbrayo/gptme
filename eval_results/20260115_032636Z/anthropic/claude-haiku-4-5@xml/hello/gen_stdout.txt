User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the appropriate print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been successfully saved. The user asked me to write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed it was saved to hello.py. I could offer to run it, but the user hasn't asked me to, so I'll wait for further instructions or just acknowledge that it's done.

Actually, since the user seems to be in interactive mode and might want to see if it works, I could offer to run it. But let me be concise and not over-explain unless needed.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script has been created. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [03:26:22] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 965 context | 0% cached
