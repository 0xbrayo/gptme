Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. The file content shows:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And I need to change it to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

This is a simple string replacement in the print statement.

Done! The code now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".                                                                                [03:26:22] Session: $0.00 | 2 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
