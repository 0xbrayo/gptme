User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to create a Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the appropriate content.

I got a permission denied error when trying to write to /app/hello.py. Let me try with a relative path instead, since the current working directory is /app. The save tool should handle relative paths.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the content that prints "Hello, world!". You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:26:22] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
