Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Let's update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". I'll apply the patch now.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
